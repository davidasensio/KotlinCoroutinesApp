# GitHub Templates - Pull Request Template

## What are GitHub Templates?

GitHub templates provide a consistent structure for pull requests and issues. The PR template ensures all contributors provide necessary information when creating pull requests, making code review more efficient and thorough.

## Official Resources

- **Documentation:** https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests

## Configuration

### Location

This template automatically populates the description field when creating a new pull request.

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Be Thorough:** Fill in all relevant sections
2. **Be Specific:** Provide detailed descriptions, not just "fix bug"
3. **Use Checkboxes:** Mark completed items with [x]

5. **Include Visuals:** Screenshots for UI, diagrams for architecture
6. **Document Testing:** Show what was tested and how

### For Reviewers

1. **Check Completeness:** Ensure all sections are filled
2. **Review Testing:** Verify adequate test coverage
3. **Request Updates:** Ask for missing information
4. **Validate Links:** Check that referenced issues/docs exist

## Template Customization

### Adding Sections

Edit `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

```markdown
## New Section üéØ
<!-- Description of new section -->

- Point 1
- Point 2
```

### Removing Sections

Simply delete unwanted sections from the template file.

### Section Order

Rearrange sections by cutting and pasting in the template file.

## Multiple Templates

You can create multiple PR templates for different purposes:

```
.github/
  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
    feature_template.md
    bugfix_template.md
    release_template.md
```

Users can then choose which template to use when creating a PR.

## CI Integration

The PR template works alongside GitHub Actions:
- Template ensures documentation is complete
- GitHub Actions ensures code quality
- Together they provide comprehensive PR validation

## Common Patterns

### Feature PR
- Focus on new functionality
- Detailed screenshots
- Comprehensive testing section

### Bug Fix PR
- Include steps to reproduce
- Show before/after behavior
- Reference original issue

### Refactoring PR
- Explain why refactoring was needed
- Document what changed structurally
- Confirm no functional changes

### Documentation PR
- List all documentation updates
- Link to affected docs
- Note any missing documentation
